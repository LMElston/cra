  </ul>
   <h2 id="h-1">Background</h2>
  <p> 
International tax evasion and avoidance have always revolved around secrecy and hiding assets, transactions, income, and wealth. What has changed over the years is the sophistication of the arrangements used by taxpayers and their representatives.</p>
<p>With historic and continued budget investments by the Government of Canada directed at collaboration, technological advancements, and sources of information, the CRA is well positioned to make sure everyone pays the taxes they owe. These measures help the CRA target those who push the legal limits of tax planning to avoid or evade taxes and side-step reporting obligations.</p>
<p>  Those that wilfully choose not to fulfill their tax obligations can face serious consequences, including criminal charges, prosecution, court imposed fines, jail time, and a criminal record.</p>

  <h2 id="h-2">We share data and exchange information</h2>
<p>

  Co-operation amongst tax administrations, including sharing data and tax information, is essential to protect the integrity of Canada's tax base and maintaining Canadians’ confidence in our self-reporting system.</p><p>

  The CRA protects all data that is exchanged with other jurisdictions. Information exchanged under a tax treaty, agreement or convention must be used only for the purposes stated in the relevant instrument, and the details of all exchanges are confidential. </p>



  <details><summary>Common Reporting Standard</summary>

<p>The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) is a global standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information between tax administrations annually. Canada and over 100 other jurisdictions have implemented the CRS. It is an important tool for promoting tax compliance, combatting international tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance, and helping ensure that taxpayers report their income from all sources and appropriately disclose their offshore assets and holdings. </p>

  <p>Since the CRA started exchanging information under the CRS in 2018, over six million records have been exchanged.  </p>

  
</details>
<details><summary>Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act</summary><p>

  In 2014, changes were enacted to the Income Tax Act in Canada to implement the Enhanced International Information Reporting and the related intergovernmental agreement associated with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)was signed between Canada and the United States (U.S.). Under the agreement and the Canadian legislation and the intergovernmental agreement, Canadian financial institutions are required to report specific information to the CRA for financial accounts held in Canada by U.S. residents and U.S. citizens. The CRA then provides this information to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on an annual basis through the provisions and safeguards of the Canada-U.S. tax treaty. The IRS reciprocates by providing similar information to the CRA on an annual basis.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Access to international electronic funds transfers </summary>

  <p>Since January 2015, the CRA has been  receiving specific electronic funds transfer (EFT) information.  This is detailed financial transaction information related to international wire transfers of $10,000 or more that are entering or leaving Canada.</p>
  <p>The CRA uses the EFT data to assess risk and identify taxpayers with potential offshore non-compliance issues.</p>
  <p>For the period of April 2016 to March 2020, the CRA conducted a project and reviewed all EFTs in four jurisdictions or financial institutions of concern each year, for a total of 16 reviews. The knowledge derived from these reviews is now integrated into the CRA’s risk assessment processes. Currently, the CRA can automatically match and integrate the EFT data with other information in our internal systems, allowing for improved risk assessment. This allows the CRA to identify the highest-risk taxpayers across multiple jurisdictions and financial institutions.</p>
</details>
 <h2 id="h-3">We collaborate internationally</h2>
 <p>Through the Forum on Tax Administration (FTA) of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), over 50
countries work together to share best practices and emerging trends,
deal with international risks, and improve compliance and the overall
delivery of tax administration.</p>
<p>The Commissioner of the CRA is currently the FTA chair. The FTA is
the only Commissioner-level organization in the world that focuses on
issues of mutual interest to all tax administrations. It harnesses the
collective expertise of its members to address issues of common
interest and concern. As a group, the FTA works together to put in
place the global standards that help to ensure greater tax certainty,
transparency, and fairness, as well as prevent tax avoidance and
evasion. This helps to create a global level playing field in tax.</p>
  <details><summary>Joint International Tax Shelter Information and Collaboration</summary>

  <p>The CRA is a member of the Joint International Tax Shelter Information and Collaboration
(JITSIC) network, which brings together 42 of the world&#39;s national tax administrations to find
ways to collaborate on a spectrum of international tax risks. The JITSIC network offers an
effective and well-established platform to enable its members to cooperate on individual cases,
as well as share their experience, resources, and expertise to tackle the issues they face in
common.<p>
<p>For example, when the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released
information on data leaks, referred to as the Pandora Papers, in October 2021, the strong
partnerships established through the JITSIC network ensured that members were well positioned
to work collaboratively and share information.</p>

 

<p>However, like tax administrations, JITSIC operates under strict rules designed to protect the
confidentiality of information and the confidence of taxpayers. As a consequence, much of the
work of JITSIC is not always visible to the public.</p>
  </details>
  <details><summary>Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement</summary>

  <p>The Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement, known as the J5, is a powerful multicounty,
operational alliance that leads the fight against international tax crime.</p>
<p>The J5 was formed in June 2018 following a call to action from the OECD for countries to more
effectively tackle the enablers of tax crime. The J5 consists of tax administration offices from the
following five countries that face common threats:</p><p>

  

<ul>

  <li>the Australian Taxation Office</li>

  <li>the CRA</li>

  <li>the Fiscale Inlichtingen- en Opsporingsdienst from the Netherlands</li>

  <li>Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs from the United Kingdom</li>

  <li>the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation from the United States</li>

<details><summary>
Country-by-country reporting</summary>
<p>Country-by-country reporting is a collaborative approach that allows countries to share revenue
and profit information on their large multinational enterprises. It helps the CRA to better assess
the risks of whether these companies are paying the right amount of tax in each country. The first
information exchanges took place in summer 2018.</p>

</details>
  <details><summary>Exchange of taxpayer-specific rulings</summary>
<p>As part of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, Canada has committed
to the spontaneous exchange of information on tax rulings with certain other countries. In the
context of the BEPS project, countries agreed to exchange information on the following types of
rulings that are relevant to the Directorate:</p>
<ul>
<li>cross-border rulings related to preferential regimes (for Canada this would include
international shipping and certain foreign life insurance operations of a Canadian
company)</li>
<li>cross-border rulings related to transfer pricing legislation </li>
<li>cross-border rulings providing a downward adjustment not directly reflected in the
taxpayers’ accounts</li>
<li>permanent establishment rulings</li>
<li>related party conduit rulings</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Ruling falls into one of the above categories, a summary of its contents may be exchanged
with the countries of residence of the immediate parent company, the ultimate parent company and certain other parties. As such, taxpayers making a Ruling request must include sufficient
information to allow the CRA to identify the relevant parties for such exchanges. For more
information, see the OECD website under BEPS.</p>
</details>
   <h2 id="h-4">We focus on offshore tax avoidance</h2>
   
   
   <p>One of the CRA’s top priorities is to protect the integrity and fairness
of Canada’s tax system by addressing tax evasion and aggressive tax
avoidance on all levels. This commitment includes tightening the net
around wealthy individuals, promoters, corporations, and entities who
try to avoid and evade taxes and who conceal assets and income
offshore.</p>
  <p>We recognize that the majority of Canadian taxpayers comply with
their tax obligations. However, there are those that knowingly
challenge and test the limits of Canada’s self-assessment tax system.</p>
<p>These individuals use their wealth to create complex tax
arrangements and litigation to avoid providing documents and
information to the CRA during an examination, audit, or investigation.
Through increased audit coverage, extensive data sources, and
enhanced analytical approaches, the CRA has greatly strengthened
its ability to detect and deter the most serious instances of non-
compliance.</p>

  <details><summary>Offshore data leaks </summary><p>While the CRA can gain useful information from data leaks, it does not depend on these leaks to
tackle offshore non-compliance. Through advancements such as EFTs, the Common Reporting
Standard, and the CRA’s <a href=
"https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/offshore-tax-informant-program.html">Offshore Tax Informant Program</a>, as well as the significant expansion of its key audit programs, the CRA is well positioned to ensure wealthy Canadians pay their taxes.</p>
<p>Audits resulting from data leaks can be intricate and lengthy. As such, additional taxes and
penalties owing are anticipated in the future as more complex and challenging data leak audits
are completed.</p>
</details>
 <details><summary>Panama Papers</summary><p>

  In 2016, the "Panama Papers" were released, which included approximately 11.5 million
documents held by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. </p><p>

  Analyzing the Panama Papers was complicated by the lack of financial information provided in
the data leak, and the fact that some taxpayers create complex structures to deliberately hide their
assets. The CRA&#39;s initial information gathering, data analysis, and risk assessment of the data

 

leak took over three years to complete. Through this process, the CRA identified over 900
Canadian individuals, corporations, and trusts to review in order to identify any with potential
tax non-compliance.</p><p>

  As of May 2022, the CRA has completed over 240 taxpayer audits linked to the Panama Papers,
resulting in assessments of more than $61 million in federal taxes and penalties. Another 160
taxpayer audits are currently ongoing.</p><p>

 It is important to highlight that holding an offshore bank account or assets does not necessarily
mean there is any tax wrongdoing. In the Panama Papers, over 60% of Canadian taxpayers
identified were found to be compliant with their tax filing and reporting obligations.</p><p>

 In addition to conducting audits, the CRA investigates individuals and businesses involved in
suspected cases of tax evasion and tax fraud, both domestically and internationally. This work is
carried out in the Criminal Investigations Program. As of March 31, 2022, there have been five
criminal investigations of tax evasion related to the Panama Papers. Three cases were
discontinued at the investigation stage, and two are currently ongoing. No criminal charges have
been laid.</p>
</details>

  <details><summary>Paradise Papers</summary><p>

 In 2017, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) released the "Paradise
Papers," which contain over 13.4 million confidential electronic documents relating to offshore
investments.</p><p>

  Since the release of the Paradise Papers, the CRA has reviewed all the taxpayers identified with a
potential connection to Canada. </p><p>
This has resulted in approximately 100 taxpayer audits completed and another 25 ongoing as of
May 2022. The audits will take several years to complete as many taxpayers have resisted
providing access to books and records, and they are also using litigation in the courts to obstruct
CRA audits. As a result, these audits can be time consuming and complex.</p><p>
</details>
  <details><summary>Pandora Papers </summary><p>

  Every data leak poses its own unique challenges. However, the CRA learned many lessons from
the Panama and Paradise papers that are guiding how it manages another recent release by the
ICIJ, the "Pandora Papers."</p><p>

  This release contains almost 12 million documents that reveal hidden wealth, tax avoidance and,
in some cases, money laundering. The CRA has been analyzing the first two datasets, released in
December 2021 and May 2022, and is identifying Canadians who pose a risk of tax non-
compliance. Over 400 Canadians have been linked to this data leak and compliance actions are
underway. The CRA will continue to analyze data as it becomes available and integrate the
intelligence gained into its existing risk assessment and analytical tools.</p><p>

 Additionally, the CRA is working with our international partners to pool resources and share
information.</p>

 </details>

<h2 id="h-5">We conduct criminal investigations</h2>


<p>The CRA is committed to protecting the integrity of Canada’s tax base by ensuring that
suspected cases of tax evasion and tax fraud are investigated and, where appropriate, referred to
the Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC) for possible criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>
A criminal investigation involves many steps such as gathering evidence, interviewing taxpayers
and witnesses, executing search warrants and analyzing evidence. The length of time required to
investigate depends on the complexity of the case, the number of individuals or corporations
involved, the availability of evidence, the need for international requests for assistance and the
level of cooperation of witnesses, all of which serves to determine whether criminal charges are
warranted.</p>
<p>
In a CRA criminal investigation, investigators prepare a comprehensive report and send it to the
PPSC. The PPSC will then independently review the evidence and decide whether or not to
prosecute. If they do, the legal process begins: charges are laid and a trial is held. The CRA
selects cases based on priority and impact on compliance. Our enhanced strategic file selection
process results in the targeting the most serious and complex cases.
</p>

<p>
As of March 31, 2022, 50% of most complex criminal investigations included the potential for
taxes evaded of $1 million or more.</p>
<p>
For the five-year period from April 1, 2017, to March 31, 2022, the courts convicted 140
taxpayers for tax evasion of more than $72 million in federal tax combined. These convictions
resulted in sentences totaling almost $17 million in court fines and 119 years in jail.</p>
<p>
Investigating bigger cases has impacted the types of cases that are prosecuted by the PPSC.
When comparing the last five fiscal years to the previous five, there has been an increase in the
average amount of federal tax evaded per conviction. For example, the average evaded tax
determined upon conviction is 73% higher than what it was previously ($299,000 from April 1,
2012, to March 31, 2017, compared to $517K from April 1, 2017, to March 31, 2022).
</p>
<p>
 

Over the last five fiscal years, we have also seen an increase in the number of convicted
taxpayers that received jail time. In fact, nearly half of taxpayers were imposed a jail sentence by
the courts, as opposed to only a third during the 2012 to 2017 fiscal years. In addition, between
April 1, 2017, and March 31, 2022, the average fine increased by 14% compared to the previous
five-year period, rising to an average of $122,000.</p>
<p>
The CRA publicizes results of successful prosecutions. The CRA may also, on occasion, release
prejudgment information at different stages of a criminal investigation or prosecution, including,
but not limited to, the execution of a search warrant, seizure of assets, and/or the laying of
criminal charges. Publishing this information serves to maintain the integrity of the tax system
and warns Canadians about potential illegal tax schemes.

<h2 id="h-6">We use compliance and legal  tools</h2>

  
  <h3>Risk-based audits</h3>
  <p>The CRA continues to use enhanced business intelligence and advanced data analysis, which has
improved its risk-assessments of individuals and businesses. For example, every year the CRA
conducts risk assessments of the corporate tax returns of all large businesses. This allows us to
focus our audit resources in the areas of highest risk.</p>
<h3>Legal tools</h3>
<p>Through a variety of effective legal tools, the CRA pursues taxpayers that knowingly challenge
and test the limits of Canada’s self-assessment tax system. By taking over 2,500 high complexity
cases to the courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada, the CRA is sending a strong
message that it won’t back down in its efforts to uncover and identify remedies for critical tax
loopholes that may be exploited by the high-wealth population.</p>
<p>We are also working diligently with our partners in the Department of Finance Canada and the
Department of Justice Canada to evaluate and introduce new and enhanced tax legislation and
policy that will help us close tax loopholes used by promoters and tax advisors to help their
clients avoid paying the appropriate amount of taxes.</p>
<details><summary>General anti-avoidance rule</summary>
<p>Since 1988, the CRA has invoked the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) when a taxpayer
attempts to circumvent or exploit the intent of Canada’s tax rules and avoid paying their fair
share. The GAAR’s purpose is to deny tax benefits to taxpayers that are not in accordance with
the object, spirit or purpose of the Income Tax Act and Excise Tax Act, even if they comply with
a literal reading of the legislation.</p>
<p>As of 2022, the CRA has applied the GAAR to more than 1,800 cases as a remedy to aggressive
tax avoidance. The number of taxpayers whose tax returns were reassessed as a result is much
greater, though, because many tax avoidance schemes involved multiple parties.</p>
<p>For more information about the GAAR, go to: <a href="canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-
publications/publications/ic88-2/general-anti-avoidance-rule-section-245-income-tax-act">General Anti-Avoidance Rule - Section 245 of the I.T</a></p>

</details>

<details><summary>Unnamed persons requirement</summary>
<p>The CRA has expanded its information sources by better leveraging ongoing audits findings and
third-party data as intelligence that help to support the use of unnamed persons requirements
(UPRs) aimed at identifying additional non-compliant taxpayers.</p>
<p>
To better detect activity in new and emerging sectors, such as crypto-asset and platform
economy activities, the CRA has increased its use of information from third parties. UPRs are a
legal tool used to gather information from third parties (such as, crypto-asset intermediaries
facilitating crypto-asset transactions) to identify taxpayers and registrants involved in crypto-
asset activities and other digital economy environments.</p>
<p>

Authorized by the courts, a UPR enables the CRA to obtain information from an individual or a
company about third parties. The CRA uses the information obtained through UPRs to identify
taxpayers that may have been non-compliant. It can then verify they have appropriately reported
their income and met their tax obligations.</p>
<p>
The CRA also uses the information obtained through UPRs to identify beneficial owners of
offshore entities, offshore bank and investment accounts.</p>
<p>
The CRA also uses UPRs as part of its strategy to address non-compliance in e-commerce. For
example, the CRA issued a UPR on a large Canadian crypto exchange and was able to collect
data on taxpayers and registrants undertaking crypto-asset activities.</p>
<p>
The CRA issues unnamed persons requirements to property developers and builders that have
information about buyers involved in an assignment sale. This information is used to identify
taxpayers who may not be reporting correctly for both income tax purposes and GST/HST
purposes.</p>

</details>
  
 
  <h2 id="h-7">We keep you informed about tax schemes</h2><p>
<p>A key part of the CRA’s compliance strategy is to target promoters of
tax schemes.</p>
  <p>Tax schemes are plans and arrangements that attempt to deceive
taxpayers by promising to reduce the taxes they owe, often through
large deductions or promises of tax-free income.</p><p>

  "Promoters" are individuals or corporations who promote or sell
schemes that seek to break or bend the rules of the Canadian tax
laws. These promoters deliberately make false statements to assist
their clients in tax cheating. As a result, these promoters obtain a
financial benefit from the remuneration they receive from their client.</p><p>

  Through increased audits of promoters, improved intelligence
gathering, and better communication with taxpayers, the CRA
continues to identify and shut down illegitimate tax shelters and tax
schemes. Those who choose to participate in or promote these
schemes may face serious consequences, including <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic01-1/third-party-civil-penalties.html">penalties</a>, court-
imposed fines, and possibly even jail time.</p><p>

<h2 id="h-8">We report on results</h2>
<p>Focusing resources on the highest-risk files means the CRA is
tightening the net around those high net-worth individuals, promoters,
corporations, and entities who try to avoid paying their taxes. This
work is having an impact and the CRA is committed to giving
Canadians access to the results of its important work against tax
evasion and aggressive tax avoidance.</p>

  <h2 id="h-9">How you can help the CRA</h2><p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Offshore Tax Informant Program (OTIP)</dt><dd><p>

  You can be eligible to be paid when you tell the CRA about
offshore tax avoidance through the Offshore <a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/offshore-tax-informant-program.html>Offshore  Tax Information Program (OTIP)</a>. </p><p>

 The OTIP was launched in January 2014 as part of its the CRA’s
efforts to fight international tax evasion and aggressive tax
avoidance. It and allows for financial rewards to be made to
individuals who provide information leading to the collection of
taxes owing that are related to major international tax evasion
and aggressive tax avoidance that leads to the collection of
taxes owing.</p><p>

  By reporting on suspected international tax non-compliance,
informants are not only benefiting from the possible rewards, but
also contribute ing to the administration of a fair tax system
where everyone pays their taxes. This ensures greater resources
are available for public facilities such as schools, roads and
hospitals, as well as for the delivery of services and programs to
Canadians. Reporting international tax non-compliance allows
for greater benefits/rewards for taxpayers.</p>
