  <p>The Canada Revenue Agency  (CRA) is aggressively pursuing individuals and businesses that engage in  non-compliance and tax fraud in Canada and abroad. Those that wilfully choose  to not fulfill their tax obligations can face serious consequences including  criminal charges, prosecution, court imposed fines, jail time and a criminal  record. </p><p>

  With continued investments and an increase in  information sources, the CRA is better positioned than ever to target  litigious, wealthy individuals who push the limits of legal tax planning or who  arrange their financial affairs with a view of flying under the CRA&rsquo;s radar.</p><p>

  Here are some of the ways we are combatting tax  cheating. </p>

  </ul>
  <h2 id="h-1">Exchange of  information</h2>
<p>

  Co-operation  amongst tax administrations, including the sharing of data and tax information,  is essential in protecting the integrity of Canada's tax base.</p><p>

  The CRA works closely and shares information with foreign  governments through various international agreements. This ensures that  Canadians, including those with operations and investments abroad, pay their  taxes. </p>



  <details><summary>Common reporting standard (CRS)</summary>

<ul>

  <li>The  Common Reporting Standard (CRS) is a global standard for the automatic exchange  of financial account information between tax administrations on an annual  basis.</li>

  <li>It  is an important tool to promote compliance, combat international tax evasion  and aggressive tax avoidance, and help ensure that taxpayers are reporting  their income from all sources.</li>

  <li>Canada  and over 100 other jurisdictions have implemented the CRS. </li>

  <li>The  CRA completed its first exchanges of CRS information with other countries in  September 2018 and will complete its fourth round of exchanges in September  2021. </li>

  <li>Since  the CRA started exchanging CRS information in 2018,  over six million records have been exchanged.</li>

  <li>These  types of tools help the CRA collect and improve the analysis of valuable  information and allows the CRA to work smarter and more effectively to ensure  all Canadians follow the rules.</li>

  <li>The  CRS allows for the automatic reporting of information on the offshore financial  accounts of non-residents, to their jurisdiction of residence. This huge set of  information includes details on the ownership of companies, trusts, and other  similar structures.</li>

</ul>
</details>
<details><summary>Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)</summary><p>

  In 2014, legislation was passed to implement the  Enhanced International Information Reporting and the related intergovernmental  agreement known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was signed  between Canada and the United States (U.S.). Under the Canadian legislation and  the intergovernmental agreement, relevant information on financial accounts  held in Canada by U.S. residents and U.S. citizens is reported to the CRA. This  information is then provided to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on an annual  basis through the provisions and safeguards of the Canada-U.S. tax treaty. The  IRS reciprocates by providing similar information to the CRA on an annual  basis. </p><p>

  The CRA would emphasize that FATCA and CRS are global,  reciprocal, exchanges intended to deter and detect offshore tax evasion and these  reciprocal exchanges benefit Canada and the fairness of tax systems across the  world.  </p><p>

  <strong>Access to international Electronic Funds  Transfers (EFTs)</strong></p><p>

  Since January  2015, the CRA has been automatically accessing all international Electronic  Funds Transfers (EFTs) of more than $10,000 entering or leaving the country. </p><p>

  Between April 1,  2016 to March 31, 2020, the CRA committed to review all of the EFTs in four new  jurisdictions or financial institutions of concern per year from 2016 to 2020  for a total of 16 jurisdictions and financial institutions of concern reviewed  - otherwise known as the JOC project. The JOC project has completed and the  intelligence derived through the review of this information is now integrated  as part of the CRA&rsquo;s risk assessment process. The CRA has the tools to  automatically match and integrate the EFT data with other information in our  systems, allowing for improved risk assessment. Based on risk algorithms, the  CRA can identify the highest risk taxpayers across multiple jurisdictions and  financial institutions. </p><p>

  It's important  to note that while the JOC project is complete, compliance activities related  to EFT data continue. During the JOC project, the CRA analyzed over 450,000 EFT  transactions with a total dollar value of the transactions analyzed was worth  over $450 million.</p><p>

  The JOC project  enabled the CRA to track the review of the EFT data, however, given its  integration in the risk assessment process as of March 31, 2020 the CRA no  longer tracks results specific to EFT data for analysis or reporting  purposes.  </p>
</details>
 <h2 id="h-2">International collaboration</h2>

  Through the Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and Development&rsquo;s (OECD) Forum on Tax Administration  (FTA), over 50 countries work together to share best practices and emerging  trends, deal with international risks, improve compliance and the overall  delivery of tax administration. </p><p>

  The CRA has  maintained a leadership role in a number of OECD initiatives with, notably, the  CRA&rsquo;s Commissioner currently being the chair of the OECD FTA. The FTA is the  only Commissioner-level body in the world that is focused on issues of mutual  interest to all tax administrations. As such, the FTA is able to harness the  collective expertise of all of its members to address issues of common interest  and concern in a concerted way. As a group, FTA works together to put in place  the global standards that help to ensure greater tax certainty, transparency  and fairness, and to prevent tax avoidance and evasion, helping to create a  global level playing field in tax.</p><p>

  <details><summary>Joint International Tax Shelter  Information and Collaboration (JITSIC)</summary><p>

  Canada continues  to be a member of the expanded Joint International Taskforce on Shared  Intelligence and Collaboration (JITSIC). This network of 42 countries works  closely and actively with other tax administrations to coordinate tax  compliance activities across the spectrum of international tax risks. The  JITSIC provides tax administrations with an agile mechanism for information  exchange and collaboration, while ensuring that all exchanges of information  are in accordance with the provisions of an effective bilateral or multilateral  tax convention or a tax information exchange agreement.</p><p>

  The FTA&rsquo;s JITSIC network provides an  effective platform to its 42 members to collaborate directly on individual  cases, as well as sharing their experience, resources and expertise and has allowed the CRA to participate and lead  JITSIC expert working groups, including the development of a strategy to  identify and stop promoters of abusive tax schemes.</p>

  <details><summary>Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement  (J5)</summary><p>

  The Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement, known as  the J5, is a powerful operational alliance that leads the fight against  international tax crime and those who facilitate it.</p><p>

  The J5 was formed in June 2018 following a call to action from the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for countries to more  effectively tackle the enablers of tax evasion. The J5 consists of five  countries who face common threats to their tax administrations. They are:</p>

   <h2 id="h-3">Focusing on offshore tax avoidance</h2>
   <p>

  The CRA is committed to  protecting the integrity and fairness of Canada&rsquo;s tax system by addressing  aggressive tax avoidance and evasion on all levels, including tightening the  net on wealthy individuals, promoters, corporations, and entities that try to  avoid paying their taxes. We recognize that the  majority of Canadian taxpayers are compliant, however, there are those that  knowingly challenge and test the limits of Canada&rsquo;s self-assessment tax system  by using their wealth to create complex tax arrangements and litigation to  avoid providing documents and information to the CRA during the course of an  examination, audit or investigation. </p><p>

  We continue to pursue those who avoid and evade taxes,  especially high net worth individuals who conceal assets and income offshore. This  has been, and continues to be, a top priority of the CRA and the Government of  Canada. Through increased audit coverage, extensive data sources and enhanced  analytical approaches, the CRA has maximized its ability to detect and deter  the most serious instances of non-compliance. </p>

  <details><summary>Offshore  Data Leaks </summary><p>

  While data leaks provide useful insights to the CRA,  we are not dependent on data leaks to tackle offshore non-compliance. Through  advancements, such as: the integration of electronic funds transfer data, the  introduction of the Common Reporting Standard and the initiation of the  Offshore Tax Informant Program (OTIP), and significant expansion of key audit  programs, the CRA is better positioned than ever to ensure wealthy Canadians  pay their taxes.</p><p>

  In regard to data leaks, it is important to emphasize  that, typically, less intricate audits are among the first to be concluded. As  such, additional federal taxes and penalties owing are anticipated in the  future as the more complex and challenging audits are completed.</p>
</details>
 <details><summary>Panama Papers</summary><p>

  April 3rd, 2016 the Panama Papers were released, which  included approximately 11.5 million documents held by the Panamanian law firm  Mossack Fonseca. </p><p>

  The initial information gathering, data analysis, and  risk assessment took the CRA over 3 years to complete  given the lack of financial information in the data leak and the fact that some  taxpayers deliberately create complex structures to hide their assets. The CRA  successfully identified approximately 900 Canadian individuals, corporations  and trusts that were reviewed to identify those that have potential Canadian  tax non-compliance.</p><p>

  In spite of the hurdles faced, the CRA has achieved  great results. As  of February 25, 2022,  there have been over 230 taxpayer audits completed linked to the Panama Papers;  resulting in more than $35 million in federal taxes and penalties assessed.  Another 165 taxpayer audits are currently ongoing.</p><p>

  It is important to emphasize that, typically, less  intricate audits are among the first to be concluded. As such, additional  federal taxes and penalties owing are anticipated in the future as the more  complex and challenging audits are completed.</p><p>

  In addition to audits, the CRA's Criminal Investigations  Program investigates individuals and businesses involved in suspected cases of  tax evasion and tax fraud, both domestically and internationally. As of December 31,  2021,  there have been 5 criminal investigations cases of tax evasion related to the  Panama Papers. 3 of those cases were discontinued at the investigation stage,  and there are 2 currently ongoing. No criminal charges have been laid. Once the  CRA has completed the 2 ongoing investigations, the CRA will have completed its  review of the Panama Papers for possible criminal prosecution.</p><p>

  CRA criminal investigations can be complex and require  years to complete. The length of time required to investigate will be dependent  on the complexity, number of individuals involved, availability of evidence,  international requests for assistance, and level of cooperation of witnesses  with a view to determine whether criminal charges are warranted. Once a case  has been referred by the CRA to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada  (PPSC), they independently review the evidence and decide whether or not to  prosecute.  </p><p>
</details>

  <details><summary>Paradise Papers</summary><p>

  Over a year after the Panama Papers, the International  Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) released the Paradise Papers on  November 5, 2017 containing over 13.4 million confidential electronic documents  relating to offshore investments.</p><p>

  Since the ICIJ released to the public the Paradise  Papers, all of the taxpayers&rsquo; identified with a potential connection to Canada  have been reviewed by the CRA. </p><p>

  This review has resulted in close to 80 taxpayer  audits completed and another 50 ongoing.  The audit work will take several years to complete as many taxpayers resist  complying with the requirement to provide access to books and records and are  using litigation in the courts to obstruct CRA audits. As a result, these  audits can be time consuming and complex. </p><p>
</details>
  <details><summary>Pandora Papers </summary><p>

  Every data leak poses its own unique challenges, however,  the CRA learned many lessons from the Panama and Paradise Papers which is  guiding the approach in managing the more recent release by the International  Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ); the Pandora Papers. </p><p>

  This data contains almost 12 million documents that  reveal hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, money laundering. The CRA has been analyzing the first two datasets released  in December 2021 and May 2022 and identifying Canadians who pose a risk of tax  non-compliance. At this time, the CRA can confirm that over 400 Canadians have  been linked to the Pandora Papers. The CRA will continue to analyze the  additional data as it becomes available and integrate the intelligence gained  into its existing compliance tools.</p><p>

  The CRA is working  with our  international partners to pool resources and share information. The CRA will  need time to validate the reliability of the data as well as the degree of tax  non-compliance from a Canadian tax perspective.</p>

<h2 id="h-4">Using compliance and legal  tools</h2><p>

  
  <h3>Auditing tools</h3>
<details><summary>CRA’s risk assessment when selecting files to audit</summary>
<p>The CRA continues to use tools like enhanced business intelligence and advanced data analysis, which has improved the risk-assessment of individuals and businesses. This allows the CRA to focus our audit resources in the areas of highest risk and helps us to deliver improved results to Canadians.</p>
<p>A large array of compliance tools, such as enhanced information sharing and collaboration with international and domestic partners, help the CRA identify high risk cases for audit and investigate cases of tax evasion.</p>
<p>Audits conducted within the High Net Worth Compliance and International and Large Business audit programs play a large role when it comes to compliance efforts to tackle aggressive tax planning and avoidance. These two areas effectively focus on the most serious cases of suspected tax avoidance, however, there are many other compliance efforts throughout the CRA that assist with projects focused on non-compliance initiatives associated with the large business, international and high wealth populations. Other examination and audit programs within the CRA address less complex instances of tax avoidance and use a variety of compliance approaches to address these lower risk cases of tax avoidance to ensure appropriate measures are used based upon the level of risk.</p>

<p>Large Business Audit:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Income  Tax Audit - Large business</li>

  <li>GST\HST  Audit - Large Business</li>

  <li>SR&amp;ED  – Large claimant </li>

</ul>

<p>The  CRA&rsquo;s Large Business Income Tax Audit Program encourages, assists and verifies  income tax compliance of the largest and most complex large  businesses/multi-national enterprises (MNE) in Canada. It is a strategically  planned program consisting of audit and enforcement measures, legislative  review and taxpayer consultation and education. These large businesses have  annual revenue greater than $250 million and include all related entities  within a corporate group. Entities that may also fall within this population  segment are large professional partnerships, investments funds, tax exempts,  and Canadian legal entities who are part of a MNE group for which a <a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/businesses-international-non-resident-taxes/country-reporting.html>Country-by-Country Report</a> (CbCR) has been filed or received via  automatic exchange.</p><p>

  Tax uncertainty  remains a significant area of concern for both MNEs and for tax  administrations. Given the ever-changing tax compliance environment, and in  particular the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)-related developments,  large businesses have elevated the issue of tax uncertainty and its potential  effect on economic growth and development.</p><p>

  The CRA uses  electronic tools to risk-assess 100% of all large business corporate tax  returns on a yearly basis, improving our ability to identify and address the  highest risk cases nationally. The objective is to make compliance easier and  provide earlier tax certainty for those large businesses that are compliant,  and make non-compliance more difficult for those that are less than cooperative  and who engage in abusive transactions. This approach helps to improve tax  fairness, promote voluntary compliance, protect the income tax base, and  maintain the integrity of the tax system on behalf of Canada.</p><p>

  <details><summary>Choosing the right battles</summary><p>

  The CRA is faced with taxpayers that knowingly challenge and test the limits of Canada’s self-assessment tax system. Using their wealth to create complex tax arrangements and litigation to avoid providing documents and information to the CRA during the course of an examination, audit or investigation. </p><p>
The CRA is pursuing aggressive taxpayers to the fullest extent possible, including in the courts. By taking over 2,500 high complexity cases to the courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), the CRA is not only sending a strong message that it won’t back down, but it is also helping uncover critical tax loopholes that are being exploited. </p><p>
Court successes show that the CRA is choosing the right battles and taking the appropriate actions.
 </p>
 
</details>
  <details><summary>GAAR</summary></p>

</details>
  <details><summary>Unnamed Persons Requirement (UPR)</summary><p>

 The CRA has expanded its compliance actions by better leveraging ongoing audits findings and third party data to support the use of unnamed persons requirements (UPRs) that in turn identify additional non-compliant taxpayers.
 </p>
  
  <p>To better detect activity in new and emerging sectors, the CRA has increased its use of information from third parties. UPRs are a legal tool used to gather information from third parties (i.e. crypto exchanges) to identify taxpayers and registrants in the crypto space.</p>
  <p>

  Authorized by the courts, a UPR enables the CRA to  obtain information from an individual or a company about third parties. The CRA  uses the information obtained through UPRs to identify taxpayers that may have  been non-compliant and verifies that they have appropriately reported their  income and have satisfied their filing obligations under the Acts administered  by the CRA.</p>
  
  <p>

  The CRA has issued UPRs over the last few years and  continues to use them to identify non-compliant taxpayers engaged in e-commerce  transactions as part of its strategy to address non-compliance in e-commerce  transactions.</p><p>

  For example, UPRs can  be used to identify taxpayers and registrants in the crypto space. The CRA  issued a UPR on a large Canadian crypto exchange and was able to collect data  on taxpayers and registrants undertaking crypto-asset activities. </p>

<p>The CRA will continue to rely on UPRs to support its  compliance mandate. </p>

</details>
  <details><summary>Criminal  Investigations</summary><p>

  The Government of  Canada is committed to protecting the integrity of Canada&rsquo;s tax base by  ensuring that suspected cases of tax evasion and tax fraud are investigated  and, where appropriate, referred to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada  (PPSC) for possible criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>A criminal  investigation involves many steps such as gathering evidence, interviewing  taxpayers and witnesses, executing search warrants and analyzing evidence. The  length of time required to investigate will be dependent on the complexity of  the case, the number of individuals and/or corporations involved, the  availability of evidence, the need for international requests for assistance,  and the level of cooperation of witnesses, all of which serves to determine  whether criminal charges are warranted.</p>

<p>In the course of a  CRA criminal investigation, a comprehensivereport is prepared by the  investigators and sent to the PPSC. The PPSC will then independently review the  evidence and decide whether or not to prosecute. If they do, the legal  process begins: charges are laid and a trial is held. The CRA selects cases  based on priority and impact on compliance. Our enhanced strategic file  selection process results in the targeting of the most serious and complex  cases.</p>

<p>As of March 31,  2022, 50% of most complex criminal investigations included the potential for  taxes evaded of $1 million or more.</p>

<p>For the five-year period, from April 1, 2017, to March  31, 2022, the courts convicted 140 taxpayers for tax evasion of more than $72  million in federal tax. These convictions resulted in sentences totaling almost  $17 million in court fines and 119 years in jail.</p>

<p>Investigating bigger cases has also impacted the types  of cases that are prosecuted. When comparing the last five fiscal years to the  previous five fiscal years, there has been an increase in the average amount of  federal tax evaded per conviction. For example, the average evaded tax  determined upon conviction is 73% higher than what it was previously ($299K  between April 1, 2012-March 31, 2017, compared to $517K between April 1,  2017-March 31, 2022).</p>

<p>Over the last five fiscal years, we have seen an  increase in the number of convicted taxpayers that received jail time. In fact,  nearly half of taxpayers were imposed a jail sentence by the courts, as opposed  to only a third during the 2012-2017 fiscal years. In addition, between April  1, 2017, and March 31, 2022, the average fine increased by 14% compared to the  previous five-year period, rising to an average of $122K. </p>

  <h2 id="h-5">Keeping you informed about tax schemes</h2><p>

  Tax  schemes are plans and arrangements that attempt to deceive taxpayers by  promising to reduce the taxes they owe, either through large deductions, or  through promising tax free income. Schemes can also include other creative ways  to convince people to pay less than what they owe. </p><p>

  &ldquo;Promoters&rdquo;  are individuals or corporations who promote or sell schemes that seek to break  or bend the rules of the Canadian tax laws. These promoters deliberately make  false statements to assist their clients in tax cheating, all the while  obtaining a financial benefit. </p><p>

  Through  increased audits of promoters, improved intelligence gathering and strengthened  communication with taxpayers, the CRA continues to identify and shut down  illegitimate tax shelters and tax schemes. Those who choose to participate in  these schemes, as well as those who promote these schemes, face serious  consequences, including penalties, court fines and possibly even jail  time. </p><p>

<h2 id="h-6">Tracking results</h2>
<p>The majority of Canadian taxpayers are compliant and make reasonable efforts to ensure they pay their fair share of taxes. However, there are those that knowingly challenge and test the limits of Canada’s self-assessment tax system.</p>
<p>Tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance deprive our country of important revenues that help fund essential programs and services such as health care, childcare and infrastructure.</p>
<h3>
Getting results</h3>

<p>Focusing resources on the highest risk files means the CRA is tightening the net on those high net-worth individuals, promoters, corporations and entities who try to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. This work is having an impact and the CRA is committed to giving Canadians access to the results of the important work the CRA is conducting to tackle tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance.</p>

  <h2 id="h-7">How you can help the CRA </h2><p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Offshore Tax Informant Program (OTIP)</dt><dd><p>

  You can be eligible to be paid when you tell the CRA  about offshore tax avoidance through the <a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/offshore-tax-informant-program.html>Offshore  Tax Information Program (OTIP)</a>. </p><p>

  OTIP was launched in January 2014 as part of it&rsquo;s  efforts to fight international tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and allows  for financial rewards to be made to individuals who provide information related  to major international tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance that leads to  the collection of taxes owing. </p><p>

  By reporting on suspected international tax  non-compliance, informants are not only benefiting from the possible rewards,  but contributing to the administration of a fair tax system where everyone pays  their taxes. This ensures greater resources are available for public facilities  such as schools, roads and hospitals; as well as for the delivery of services  and programs to Canadians- reporting international tax non-compliance allows  for greater benefits/rewards for tax payers.</p>

  If you suspect a  person, business or charity of tax or benefitcheating in Canada, report  them to the CRA by submitting a lead to the <a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/suspected-tax-cheating-in-canada-overview.html>Leads Program</a>.</p>
</dd>
  <dt>Voluntary Disclosures Program </dt><dd><p>

  You can reduce the  impact of previous errors in your own tax returns. Under the <a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html>Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP)</a> taxpayers can correct errors in their tax  affairs. Recent changes make it tougher for those who intentionally avoid their  tax obligations to benefit from the VDP, while maintaining the program for  Canadians looking to correct tax filing mistakes.<strong><u> </u></strong></p>
