                <h2 id="h-1">We may ask you for additional information</h2>
                <p>Once the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has started reviewing your request, we may contact you if we need any help understanding what you provided, or to get any missing information.</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-2">How we review your request</h2>
                <p>It is a general CRA practice for another CRA official, or committee of officials, to review a request and prepare a decision report for the designated official's consideration, including a recommendation on whether or not granting relief is justified. It is the responsibility of the designated official to make the final decision and notify the taxpayer in writing.</p>
                
                <h3>Factors used in arriving at the decision</h3>
                <p>Where circumstances beyond your control, actions of the CRA, or inability to pay or financial hardship has prevented you from complying with your tax obligations, the following factors will be considered when determining whether or not the CRA will cancel or waive penalties or interest:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>your history of compliance with your tax obligations</li>
                  <li>whether or not you knowingly allowed an arrears balance to exist upon which arrears interest has accrued</li>
                  <li>whether or not you exercised a reasonable amount of care in conducting your tax affairs, and whether or not negligence or carelessness has been demonstrated</li>
                  <li>whether or not you acted quickly to remedy any delay or omission</li>
                </ul>

                            <section>
                <h2 id="h-3">When you can expect a decision</h2>
                <p>Under normal circumstances, the CRA tries to issue a taxpayer relief decision within 180 calendar days of receiving the request. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a higher than normal number of requests for relief, it could take longer to process your request. For the most up to date information about our processing timeframe, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/check-cra-processing-times.html">Check CRA processing times</a>.</p>

                <p>If the CRA approves your request for relief, you will receive one of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>reduction in refunds</li>
                  <li>refund interest</li>

                <h2 id="h-6">Recourse if your request is denied or partially approved</h3>
                <p>If you believe our decision was not fair and reasonable, there are recourse options available to you.</p>
				<h3>Second administrative review</h3>
                <p>You can ask for a second review online, see <a href="file://omega.dce-eir.net/natdfs/CRA/HQ/Appeals/Appeals_H0Z/GV1/RRBSD/BPMSD/CCR/COMMS/2.%20EXTERNAL/CANADA.CA/TAXPAYER%20RELIEF/GitHub%20files/taxpayer-relief/cancel-waive-penalties-interest/how-apply-d.html#h-2"> Submit your request</a> for more information. Alternatively, you can send a letter to one of the following:
				<ul><li>address provided in the decision letter you received
		<li><a href="file://omega.dce-eir.net/natdfs/CRA/HQ/Appeals/Appeals_H0Z/GV1/RRBSD/BPMSD/CCR/COMMS/2.%20EXTERNAL/CANADA.CA/TAXPAYER%20RELIEF/GitHub%20files/taxpayer-relief/cancel-waive-penalties-interest/how-apply-d.html#h-2">Intake Centre</a> responsible for your province or territory of residence</p></li>
				</ul>
                <p>A second review request requires the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the reasons why you disagree with the CRA's decision, for example, not all information was considered, certain facts or details were missing or misinterpreted or not considered in their proper context</li>
                  <li>any relevant new documents, new facts, or correspondence</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Judicial review</h3>
                <p>If you still feel that we were not fair and reasonable, you can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/judicial-review.html"> apply to the Federal Court for a judicial review</a> of our decision. You must do this within 30 calendar days of the date you received the decision from the second review. To maintain fairness and transparency, the CRA official who completed the first review will not conduct the second review. <p>
                 <h3>Requestion for remission review</h3>
                <p>If we deny your request to cancel or waive interest or penalties, you <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/when-request-remission-review.html">may be able to make a remission request<a>.</p>
