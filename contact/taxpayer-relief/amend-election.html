		<p>In some instances, the Income Tax Act allow taxpayers to choose when and how they want to be taxed. These provisions are called “elections”.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, a taxpayer can choose between:
<ul><li>using a default set of tax rules</li> 
	<li>electing (choosing) an alternative set of rules</li></p></ul>
<p>This "election" gives taxpayers both options and flexibility.</p>

                    <summary>Inability to pay or financial hardship</summary>
                    <p>The CRA may, in circumstances where there is a confirmed inability to pay amounts owing, consider waiving or cancelling interest in whole or in part to enable taxpayers to pay their account. For example, this could occur when:</p>  
                    <ul> 
                      <li>a collection has been suspended because of an inability to pay caused by the loss of employment and the taxpayer is experiencing financial hardship</li> 
                      <li>a taxpayer is unable to conclude a payment arrangement because the interest charges represent a significant portion of the payments, or</li> 
                      <li>payment of the accumulated interest would cause a prolonged inability to provide basic necessities (financial hardship) such as food, medical help, transportation, or shelter; consideration may be given to cancelling all or part of the total accumulated interest</li> 
                    </ul>  
                    <p>Consideration would not generally be given to cancelling a penalty based on an inability to pay or financial hardship unless an extraordinary circumstance prevented compliance, or an exceptional situation existed. For example, when a business is experiencing extreme financial difficulty and enforcement of such penalties would jeopardize the continuity of its operations, the jobs of the employees, and the welfare of the community as a whole, consideration may be given to providing relief of the penalties.</p>
                    <p>For requests to cancel or waive interest or penalties based on an inability to pay or financial hardship, the CRA requires full financial disclosure from taxpayers, including a statement of income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.

            <p>When accepted by the CRA, a late or amended election will be considered to have been made at the time it was required to be made. For amended or revoked elections, the original election will be cancelled. To give effect to the acceptance of a late, amended, or revoked election, the CRA will reassess the affected returns for the tax years in question even if the years are beyond the normal reassessment period.</p>  <p>Any assessments or reassessments resulting from the CRA's acceptance of the request is subject to the general provisions concerning arrears interest charged on the balance owing.</p>  
                
            <h3>Disqualifying circumstances</h3>
            <p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will not accept a request in the following instances:</p>  
            <ul> 
                <li>it is reasonable to conclude you made the request for retroactive tax planning purposes, e.g., taking advantage of changes to the law enacted after the due date of the election;</li> 
                <li>adequate records do not exist; and</li> 
                <li>it is reasonable to conclude you had to make the request because you were negligent or careless in complying with the law. </li>

            <h3>Include payment of the amendment penalty</h3>
            <p>If the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) accepts your late, amended, or revoked election request, you are liable to a penalty.</p>  
            <p>The penalty is the lesser of the following amounts:</p>  
            <ol class="alpha dblSpList"> 
                <li>$8,000; or</li> 
                <li>$100 for each complete month from the election's original due date to the date your request was made in a form satisfactory to the CRA.</li> 
            </ol>  
            <p>The date on which you made the request in a form satisfactory to the CRA is when you have provided the CRA with complete and accurate information for the election under review. Please see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/late-amended-revoked-elections/information-you-must-include-your-request.html">Information you must include with your request</a> for details about providing complete and accurate information.</p>  

            <h3>Payment of the penalty amount</h3>
            <ul> 
                <li>It is CRA policy not to accept late, amended, or revoked elections, or to process or adjust the income tax return, unless the penalty amount noted above is paid.</li> 
                <li>Penalty payments should be sent to the CRA with your request.</li> 
                <li>The CRA will determine and assess any unpaid balance of the penalty, which the taxpayer must immediately pay.</li> 
            </ul>  
            
            <h3>Relief from the penalty</h3>
            <p>In certain circumstances, the CRA may cancel or waive the penalty amount.</p>
            <p><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/cancel-waive-penalties-interest.html">Cancel or waive penalties or interest</a>.</p>  <p class="mrgn-lft-md"></p> 
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> A request to waive the penalty amount may be submitted with the request to file a late, amended, or revoked election. You do not have to file a separate penalty relief request.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="h-4">After you make a request</h2>
            <p>It is a general CRA practice for another CRA official, or a committee of CRA officials, to prepare a decision report for the designated official's consideration, including a recommendation on whether or not granting relief is warranted. The final decision, including notifying you of the decision, is the responsibility of the designated official.</p>
            <p>When the review of your request is underway, we may contact you if we need any clarification of the facts and reasons, or to obtain any missing information.</p>
            <p>In all cases, once the review of your request is complete, we will notify you of our decision, including the reason for the decision if it is only partially approved or denied.</p>
            <p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/cancel-waive-penalties-interest/approval-denial-your-request.html">how we review your request</a>.</p>
  
            <h3>Recourse if your request is denied</h3>
            <h4>Right of objection</h4>
            <p>Taxpayers have the right to object in the following two situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If your late, amended, or revoked election is accepted, you can file an objection to dispute the resulting assessment or reassessment. However, the objection is limited to issues related to that election.</li>
                <li>If an original Notice of Assessment is made to allow a refund from filing an income tax return beyond the normal three-year period for an individual (other than a trust) or a graduated rate estate, the normal objection procedures apply.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Second administrative review</h4>
            <p>If you believe the CRA did not properly exercise its discretion in considering your request, you can ask for a second review. You may request a second review by writing to the address provided in the decision letter you received in reply to your first request for relief, or by writing to the Intake Centre responsible for your province or territory of residence.</p>
            <p>A second review request requires the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the reasons why you disagree with the CRA's decision, e.g., not all information was considered, certain facts or details were missing or misinterpreted or not considered in their proper context</li>
              <li>any relevant new documents, new facts, or correspondence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To maintain impartiality and transparency, the second review will not be conducted by the CRA official involved in the first review and decision.</p>
            <p>The CRA may still uphold its previous decision following a second review of your request for relief. If you feel that the discretion was not properly exercised during the second review, you can apply to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the CRA decision within 30 days of the date you received the CRA second review decision.</p>
            <h4>Judicial review</h4>
            <p>If you believe the CRA did not properly exercise its discretion in arriving at the decision, you can apply for judicial review of that decision to the Federal Court within 30 days of the date you received the CRA decision.</p>
