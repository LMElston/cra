        <h2 id="howmuch">How much you can claim</h2>
            <p>The Saskatchewan Home Renovation Tax Credit helps offset the cost of home renovations. You can claim renovation costs <b>over $1,000,</b> and up to:</p>
         <ul>
                <li>$12,000 for the 2021 tax year</li>
                <li>$10,000 for the 2022 tax year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The base amount of $1,000 is <b>subtracted</b> from your claim. That means if your costs were $10,000, you would claim $9,000.</p>
            
        
            <h2 id="elig">Eligibility</h2>
             <h3 id="who">Who the credit is for</h3>
        <p>The credit is available to residents of Saskatchewan who renovated their principal residence. You or your family must have lived at the residence during the time of the renovation.</p>
   
      
<p>For the purposes of the credit, a family is defined as:</p>
                <li>an individual</li>
                 <li>a spouse or common-law partner</li>
                  <li>their children who were under the age of 18 years at the end of year for which the credit is claimed</li>
          
<p>More than one family member can claim credits separately. Eligible expenditures not claimed by one family member can be claimed by another family member. The total amount claimed by all family members can not exceed the maximum of $12,000 for 2021 or $10,000 for 2022.</p>
            
<h4>Joint ownership</h4>
 <p>When two or more families share the ownership of an eligible dwelling, each family can claim a separate  amount based on their respective eligible expenditures. The maximum amount of eligible expenses is applied to each family making the claim.</p>
            
        <details>
            <summary><b>Example:</b> Renovations of a jointly owned home</summary>
            <p>
            Olga and her brother, Sven, jointly own a house. Olga paid $14,000 and Sven paid $11,000 to renovate the bathroom and the kitchen in June 2021. Because Sven and Olga are adult siblings, they are considered 2 separate families. They will use these calculations: 
                
                <h4><b>Olga's claim</b></h4>
                Total costs incurred: $14,000
                Total eligible expenses (for the 2021 tax year): $12,000
                Subtract the base amount: -$1,000
                Home Renovation expenses: <b>$11,000</b>
            </p>
