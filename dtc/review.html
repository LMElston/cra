                <h2 id="h-1">Our review of your application</h2>
                <p>After we receive your application, we assess it to determine if you are eligible for the Disability tax credit (DTC). We base our analysis on the information given by the medical practitioner.</p>
		    <p>If we need more information, we may contact you or the medical practitioner.</p>

	

                <h3><span class="far fa-clock"></span> How long it will take</h3>
		    <p>We aim to process your application and send you a notice of determination within 8 weeks of getting your application. It may take longer if information is missing.</p>
		    <p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/check-cra-processing-times.html">Check CRA processing times</a></p>
<p>If you send your application with your tax return, the CRA will review your application before assessing your tax return.</p>

                <h2 id="h-2">Replying to a clarification letter</h2>
                <p>We may send you a clarification letter asking for more information, such as supporting documents or receipts. The letter will contain a reference number and instruction on what you need to do.</p>

		    
		    <p>You may send us the requested information using  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>.</p>



                <h2 id="h-3">Our decision about your application</h2>
		    <p>We will send you a notice of determination to inform you of our decision.</p>
               
		    <h3><span class="fas fa-check text-success"></span> If your application is approved</h3>
                 <p>If your DTC application is approved, you may claim the tax credit on your income tax return. This may reduce the amount of income tax you have to pay.</p>
		    <p>Your notice of determination will show which year(s) you can claim the DTC. You don't need to re-apply for the credit every year, unless we tell you that you need to.</p>
		    <p>The DTC also opens doors to other federal, provincial, and territorial programs. Your notice of determination may include information about other programs that are dependent on DTC eligibility, such as:</p>
		    <ul>
		        <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-disability-savings-plan-rdsp.html">Registered disability savings plan</a></li>
		        <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-workers-benefit.html">Canada workers benefit</a></li>
			    <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-disability-benefit.html">Child disability benefit</a></li>
		    </ul>

<p>Most approved applications expire after a certain number of years and you will have to re-apply. When your eligibility is about to expire, we will notify you 1 year in advance, as well as in the year it expires.</p>
<p>You can view your DTC information in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>.</p>
<p>You must tell us if your medical condition improves to the point that you no longer meet the criteria for the DTC.</p>
		    
		   

                <h3><span class="fas fa-times text-danger"></span> If your application is denied</h3>

		    <p>If your DTC application is denied, your notice of determination will explain why.</p>
		    <p>Check your copy of your application, Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate, against the reason(s) given. We base our decision on the information given by the medical practitioner.</p>
