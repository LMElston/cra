                            <h2 id="h-1">How the DTC works</h2>
		    <h3>The DTC has a 2-step process</h3> 
		    <p>There are 2 steps to the DTC:</p>
 <ol class="lst-stps">
    <li><h4>Apply</h4><p>First you have to apply which involves you and a medical practitioner who can certify the effects of your impairment</p></li>
    <li><h4>Claim</h4><p>If approved you can then claim the credit on your taxes to reduce the tax you may owe</p></li>
</ol>

		    
		    
		    
		    <p>Everyone who  qualifies should apply for the DTC, regardless of whether they get a tax  refund. Being approved for the DTC can open the door  to other federal, provincial, or territorial programs, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-disability-savings-plan-rdsp.html">Registered disability savings plan</a></li>

          <p><strong>NARRATOR:</strong> (Friendly, congenial voice over warm music)</p>
          <p>Apply for the disability tax credit in one, two, three easy steps</p>
          <p>People who have a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions often have extra expenses that other taxpayers don’t. The disability tax credit helps to offset some of those costs.</p>
          <p>The disability tax credit is a non-refundable tax credit. This means that, when you fill out your income tax and benefit return, the credit reduces the amount of income tax you might have to pay. Applying for the credit is easy. Just follow these three steps.</p>
          <p>Step One: Fill in the basic personal information on Part&nbsp;A of Form T2201, which is called the Disability Tax Credit Certificate.</p>
          <p><strong>LUC (EMMA’S DAD):</strong> When I learned that Emma might be eligible for the disability tax credit, I wanted to apply for it right away. &nbsp;It was easy.</p>
          <p>I only had to complete Part A of the form with my basic personal information and Emma’s, and then I took the form to our medical practitioner.</p>
          <p><strong>NARRATOR:</strong> Step Two: Ask your medical practitioner to fill out Part&nbsp;B of the form.</p>
          <p><strong>MEDICAL PRACTITIONER:</strong> My patients often ask me to complete Part B of Form T2201, so I’m familiar with it. I always tell them applying for the disability tax credit is really a simple and straightforward process.</p>
          <p><strong>NARRATOR:</strong> Step Three: Mail the completed and signed form to the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>
          <p><strong>ÉVELYNE (JOANNE’S DAUGHTER):</strong> My mother’s medical practitioner has been a lifeline for her. She helped Mom find support and fill out Form T2201. Now that it’s filled out and signed by my mother and her doctor, we just need to mail it to the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>
          <p><strong>NARRATOR:</strong> Life is more challenging for people who have a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions.</p>
          <p>Applying for the disability tax credit can provide some relief.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>You don’t need to wait until tax time. Apply anytime to find out if you qualify. Then, when tax time rolls around, we’ll be able to process your income tax return faster.</p>
          <p>Being eligible for the disability tax credit might also open the door to other government programs, including the registered disability savings plan, the working income tax benefit, and the child disability benefit.</p>
          <p>Apply for the disability tax credit today!</p>
          <p>For more information, go to <strong>cra.gc.ca/dtc</strong> or call: 1-800-959-8281</p>
          <p>Three easy steps - it’s as easy as 1, 2, 3!</p>

		    <h3>Understanding non-refundable tax credits</h3>
		    <p>The DTC is a tax credit, not a benefit or payment. It is a non-refundable tax credit and if approved, you can  claim on your tax return to help reduce the taxes you may owe.</p>
		    
		    
		    

		    <h3>Tax credit amounts</h3>
		    
		    <p>The following chart shows the maximum credit amounts for the DTC and the maximum supplement for children for the current and prior years. </p>

                            <h2 id="h-2">How people benefit from the DTC</h2>

                           <p>Meet some of the people who may be eligible for the DTC or other government programs for persons with disabilities:</p>


    <details class="mrgn-tp-sm mrgn-bttm-md"> 
	<summary>Adam needs kidney dialysis</summary>
		<p>Adam is a university student who required kidney dialysis before receiving a kidney transplant.</p>

<p>Adam applied for the DTC. As a result of the information provided by the medical practitioner on the DTC application form, he was eligible for the disability tax credit for the period he was receiving dialysis which he needed as a life-sustaining therapy for at least 14 hours per week.</p>

<p>As Adam has little taxable income and his parents help with his food, clothing, and shelter throughout the year, they may claim any unused portion of the tax credit.</p>

<p>Because he is eligible for the DTC, Adam may also be eligible for other government programs for persons with disabilities such as the registered disability savings plan.</p>

    <details class="mrgn-tp-sm mrgn-bttm-md"> 
	<summary>Lisa’s son Nicolas needs insulin therapy</summary>
		<p>Lisa is a single parent. Her son, Nicolas, needs insulin therapy.</p>

<p>Lisa applied for the disability tax credit (DTC) for her son. As a result of the information provided by the medical practitioner on the DTC application form, Nicolas is now eligible for the tax credit because he cannot monitor and adjust his insulin dosage himself.</p>

<p>Lisa may claim the tax credit, which includes a supplement for persons under 18 years of age at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Since Nicolas is eligible for the DTC, Lisa may also be eligible for other government programs for persons with disabilities such as the child disability benefit.</p>
