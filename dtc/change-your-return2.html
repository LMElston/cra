    <h3>Processing time</h3>
    <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s goal is to send you a notice of reassessment, or a letter explaining why the CRA did not make the changes you asked for, as well as any refund within:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 weeks, when you request an adjustment online</li>
      <li>8 weeks, when you file a paper adjustment request</li>
    </ul>

      <br>
      Processing timeframes apply to routine adjustment requests. Some change requests are considered complex and will take longer to process due to the additional verification required. They include situations where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the CRA has to contact you or your authorized representative for more information or documentation</li>
      <li>your request is to adjust multiple tax returns, or tax years beyond the normal <span class="nowrap">3 year</span> reassessment period</li>
      <li>your request is for a bankruptcy return</li>
      <li>your request is related to a deceased taxpayer</li>
      <li>you request a carryback amount such as capital or <span class="nowrap">non-capital</span> losses</li>
      <li>your request is related to an international or non-resident client</li>
      <li>your request is for the elected <span class="nowrap">split-pension</span> amount</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The CRA wants to assure you that processing your request is our highest priority. The time required to complete a complex adjustment request varies with the type of adjustment and the circumstances involved. The CRA continually strives to find the right balance between processing timeliness and the need to protect the integrity of our<span class="nowrap"> self-assessment </span>tax system.</p>
    <h3>When the review is done the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will send you one of the following:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>a notice of reassessment showing any changes to your return</li>
      <li>a letter explaining why the CRA did not make the changes you asked for or if no changes were needed</li>
    </ul>
