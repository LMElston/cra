            <h2 id="h-3">How to claim for a dependant</h2>
            <h3>If your dependant was 17 or younger</h3>
            <p>The parent or guardian approved on the DTC application form may claim the disability amount for their child.</p>
		<p>To claim for a dependant who was 17 years or younger at the end of the year:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Complete the chart for line 31600 on your Worksheet for the return in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years.html">income tax package</a> to calculate the supplement for children with disabilities that your dependant may be able to claim</li>

                <li>Complete the chart for line 31800 on your Worksheet for the return in the income tax package to calculate your claim for each dependant</li>
            </ol>

		
            <p><strong>If you pay child support:</strong> You cannot claim the disability amount transferred from a child for whom you had to pay child support. However, special rules may apply if you were separated from your spouse or common-law partner for only part of 2021 due to a breakdown in your relationship.</p>


            <h3>If your dependant was 18 or older</h3>
            <p>To claim for a dependant who was 18 years or older at the end of the year, complete the chart for line 31800 on the Worksheet for the return in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years.html">income tax package</a> to calculate your claim for each dependant.</p>

            <h3>Exceptions to claiming </h3>
            <p>You cannot claim the unused part of the disability amount if the spouse or common-law partner of your dependant is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>claiming the disability amount for your dependant already</li>
                <li>claiming any other non-refundable tax credit (other than medical expenses) for your dependant</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you or anyone else paid for attendant care, or for care in a facility, special rules may apply.</p>

            <p>For details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-32600-amounts-transferred-your-spouse-common-law-partner.html">Attendant care and care in a facility</a></p> 

            <h2 id="h-4">Splitting the amount with another supporting person</h2>

            <p>To split the unused part of the disability amount with another supporting person, include a note with your tax return with the name and SIN of the other person who is claiming the amount. The total claimed for the dependant cannot be more than the maximum disability amount allowed for that dependant.</p>
		<p>You <strong>cannot split the claim</strong> with another person if they claimed an amount on line 30400 for the dependant.</p>
