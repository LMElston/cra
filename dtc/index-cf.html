                    <p>The disability tax credit (DTC) is a non-refundable tax credit that helps persons with disabilities or their supporting persons reduce the amount of income tax they may have to pay. An individual may claim the disability amount once they are eligible for the DTC. This amount includes a supplement for persons under 18 years of age at the end of the year.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the DTC is to provide for greater tax equity by allowing some relief for disability costs, since these are unavoidable additional expenses that other taxpayers don’t have to face.</p>
                    <p>You may re-apply up to a total of 25 eligibility periods (50&nbsp;weeks) between <span class="nowrap">September 27, 2020</span> and <span class="nowrap">September 25, 2021</span>.</p>

                    <p><strong>NARRATOR:</strong> (Friendly, congenial voice over warm music)</p>
                    <p>Apply for the disability tax credit in one, two, three easy steps</p>
                    <p>People who have a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions often have extra expenses that other taxpayers don’t. The disability tax credit helps to offset some of those costs.</p>
                    <p>The disability tax credit is a non-refundable tax credit. This means that, when you fill out your income tax and benefit return, the credit reduces the amount of income tax you might have to pay. Applying for the credit is easy. Just follow these three steps.</p>
                    <p>Step One: Fill in the basic personal information on Part&nbsp;A of Form T2201, which is called the Disability Tax Credit Certificate.</p>
                    <p><strong>LUC (EMMA’S DAD):</strong> When I learned that Emma might be eligible for the disability tax credit, I wanted to apply for it right away. &nbsp;It was easy.</p>
                    <p>I only had to complete Part A of the form with my basic personal information and Emma’s, and then I took the form to our medical practitioner.</p>
                    <p><strong>NARRATOR:</strong> Step Two: Ask your medical practitioner to fill out Part&nbsp;B of the form.</p>
                    <p><strong>MEDICAL PRACTITIONER:</strong> My patients often ask me to complete Part B of Form T2201, so I’m familiar with it. I always tell them applying for the disability tax credit is really a simple and straightforward process.</p>
                    <p><strong>NARRATOR:</strong> Step Three: Mail the completed and signed form to the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>
                    <p><strong>ÉVELYNE (JOANNE’S DAUGHTER):</strong> My mother’s medical practitioner has been a lifeline for her. She helped Mom find support and fill out Form T2201. Now that it’s filled out and signed by my mother and her doctor, we just need to mail it to the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>
                    <p><strong>NARRATOR:</strong> Life is more challenging for people who have a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions.</p>
                    <p>Applying for the disability tax credit can provide some relief.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You don’t need to wait until tax time. Apply anytime to find out if you qualify. Then, when tax time rolls around, we’ll be able to process your income tax return faster.</p>
                    <p>Being eligible for the disability tax credit might also open the door to other government programs, including the registered disability savings plan, the working income tax benefit, and the child disability benefit.</p>
                    <p>Apply for the disability tax credit today!</p>
