                <h4 id="h-3-1-1">Choose your expenditure calculation method</h4>
                <p>You may only select one method, either proxy or traditional, for each tax year for which you want to claim SR&amp;ED expenditures. Your selection cannot be changed for the tax year once your claim is filed.</p>

                <h5>Traditional method</h5>
                <p>The traditional method involves identifying each overhead cost that was incurred solely because of the SR&amp;ED work.</p>
                <p>For detailed policy information, please refer to the <a href="">Traditional and Proxy Methods Policy</a>.</p>
