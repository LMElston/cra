                    <h2 id="h-1">What is the SR&amp;ED tax credit</h2>
                    <p>The Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&amp;ED) Program uses tax incentives to encourage Canadian businesses of all sizes and in all sectors to conduct research and development (R&amp;D) in Canada.</p>
                        
                    <p>There are two main benefits of claiming the SR&amp;ED tax credit:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>You can pool your SR&amp;ED expenditures and deduct them against your current-year income or keep them and deduct them in a future year</li>
                    <li>You can claim the SR&amp;ED investment tax credit (ITC) and use it to reduce your income tax payable. In some cases, the CRA can refund the remaining ITC</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Whatever eligible SR&amp;ED work you are doing, your ITC will be at least 15% and can be as much as 35% of your qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures. If you have any unused ITCs, you can carry them back 3 years or forward 20 years and apply them against tax payable for other years.</p>
                    <p>Corporations, individuals, trusts and members of a partnership can use these Government of Canada incentives.</p>
                    
                    
                    <!--<h2 id="h-2">How the SR&amp;ED tax incentive program works</h2>

                    <p>There are two main benefits of the SR&amp;ED tax incentives:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>You can pool your SR&amp;ED expenditures and deduct them against your current-year income or keep them and deduct them in a future year</li>

                    <h2 id="h-3">What your business can earn</h2>

                    <p>How much your business can claim depends on the type of business and the qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures your business has.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Canadian-controlled private corporations</h3>
                    <p>Generally, most  Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPC) can earn a refundable ITC at the enhanced rate of 35% on qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures  up to their expenditure limit for the tax year (maximum expenditure limit is $3 million). You can also earn a non-refundable ITC at the basic rate of 15% on an amount over your expenditure limit. However, if  a CCPC also meets the definition of a qualifying corporation, 40% of the ITC earned at 15% can be refunded.</p>
                    <details>
                    <summary>What is the expenditure limit?</summary>
                        <p>The maximum expenditure limit for purposes of the 35% ITC rate is $3 million. However, if the prior year’s taxable capital employed in Canada of the claimant and any associated corporation is more than $10 million, a reduction of the expenditure limit will occur. If the CCPC is associated with other corporations, the resulting expenditure limit calculated is shared, and must be allocated amongst the associated corporation on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch49.html">T2 Schedule 49</a></p>
                    </details>
                
                    
                    <h3>Other corporations</h3>
                    <p>You can claim a non-refundable ITC at the basic rate of 15% on qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures. You can use the ITC to reduce tax payable.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Individuals and trusts</h3>
                    <p>Individuals (proprietorships) and trusts can claim a refundable ITC at the basic rate of 15% on qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures. You first must apply the ITC against tax payable before the CRA can refund 40% of the unclaimed balance of ITCs earned in the year.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Members of a partnership</h3>
                    <p>Since a partnership is not a taxpayer, you cannot earn an ITC. In general, the ITC is calculated at the partnership level then allocated to eligible members (individuals, corporations or trusts). If you are considering submitting a partnership claim for SR&amp;ED, read the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/claims-partnerships-policy.html">SR&amp;ED Claims for Partnerships Policy</a>.</p>
