                </ul>
                <h2 id="h-1">Identify your eligible work</h2>
                <p>An SR&ED project is the grouping of the work you identified as eligible.</p>
                <p>Each SR&ED project you claim corresponds to a set of interrelated activities that collectively are necessary in an attempt to achieve scientific or technological advancement. This attempt is pursued through a systematic investigation or search in a field of science or technology by means of experiment or analysis.</p>
                
                <h3 id="h-1-1">The start of the project</h3>
                <p>The start of an SR&ED project is when you recognize the existence of scientific or technological uncertainty, and you commence work to address or resolve that uncertainty. Recognizing that there is scientific or technological uncertainty is a key step in the systematic investigation or search and shows the need to begin an SR&ED project to address or resolve this uncertainty.</p>
                
                <h3 id="h-1-2">The duration of the project</h3>
                <p>The duration of an SR&ED project is not a factor in determining whether the work performed meets the definition of SR&ED. Some projects are short, carried out fully within one tax year, while other projects extend over several tax years. As an SR&ED project can span more than one year, a snapshot of the work in a given year may not reflect the overall effort to achieve the scientific or technological advancement. Once an SR&ED project has started, work in any year that is part of the attempt to achieve that advancement is considered part of the SR&ED project.</p>
                
                <h3 id="h-1-3">The completion of the project</h3>
                <p>The SR&ED project is complete when the scientific or technological knowledge needed has been gained and you have achieved your objective, or when you decide to abandon further attempts to resolve the scientific or technological uncertainty. Success, failure, marketability, or commercial significance of work is not relevant to determining its eligibility. Commercialization or certification might not necessarily mean that the SR&ED project is complete. Neither financial indicators (such as first sale) nor issuing warranties alone are enough to mark the end of an SR&ED project.</p>
                
                <h3 id="h-1-4">How an SR&ED project relates to your business project</h3>
                <p>After gaining an understanding of the meaning of an SR&ED project, the next step is to look at how an SR&ED project relates to the projects your business conducts. SR&ED can be planned within your business and, in this case, it may be easier to identify the eligible work. However, there are often cases when SR&ED is not planned and occurs because you encountered scientific or technological uncertainty in the course of your business project. In either case, you will need to track and identify the eligible work within your business project(s) and group it into SR&ED project(s).</p>


            
                <h2 id="h-2">Group your eligible work</h2>
                <p>To file an SR&ED claim, group your eligible work into one or more SR&ED projects. There are several possible scenarios you may encounter when identifying and grouping your work:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>All of the work in a given business project is eligible and forms one SR&ED project.</li>
                <li>Your business project contains a mix of eligible and ineligible work. In this case, you need to segregate the eligible work and group it into one or more SR&ED projects.</li>
                <li>The SR&ED work is occurring across multiple business projects, but when grouped together, it forms an SR&ED project.</li>
                <li>Your business project does not contain any SR&ED work.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Key points to consider when grouping work from your business project(s) into SR&ED project(s):</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>Eligible work can happen at any time in your business projects.</li>
                <li>Both SR&ED and non-SR&ED work can happen concurrently.</li>
                <li>The earlier you can identify eligible work in your business projects, and start tracking it, the easier it will be when it comes time to prepare your claim.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>How you organize your business project is up to you. What is important is that you are able to identify and group your eligible work into SR&ED projects when it's time to file your claim.</p>


                <h2 id="h-3">Gather supporting information</h2>
                <h3 id="h-3-1">Technical information</h3>

                <p>The information used to support SR&ED work is often called "supporting evidence." Documents that were generated when the work was being carried out are the most common, but supporting evidence can also include items such as photographs, videos, scrap, or other artefacts that relate to the work.</p>
                
                <p>The best supporting evidence is documentation that is dated and specific to the work performed. However, we will accept various forms of evidence. Most importantly, the evidence you keep must support the information you provided in your application.</p>
                
                <h3 id="h-3-1">Financial information</h3>


                <p>You must also keep complete and organized records that support the expenditures you claim. How long to keep your records can vary but, in general, all required records and supporting documents must be kept for a period of six years from the end of the last tax year they relate to. For general information on records needed to support financial transactions please visit Keeping records. Records and documents that may be asked for during a review include financial statements, ledgers, journals and vouchers, including electronic records. We may also ask for source documents such as receipts, contracts and general correspondence.</p>

                <h2 id="h-4">SR&ED in production and manufacturing environments</h2>
                <p>In production or manufacturing environments, SR&ED often occurs concurrently with excluded or other non-SR&ED work. It is important to keep track of your SR&ED work separately.</p>
                <p>If you are developing an asset, or operating equipment or processes in a production or manufacturing environment,  these documents explain how to segregate SR&ED work and the associated expenditures:</p>
