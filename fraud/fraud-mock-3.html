	  <h3>Phishing text message offering a refund</h3>

	   
	  <p><strong>What is it: </strong>A phishing text message scam impersonating the CRA to offer refunds to Canadians, targeting any Canadian year round. </p>
<p><strong>How to recognize it: </strong>Scammers are using a method known as spoofing to hide their number and show a different number on your phone display. They will claim to be the CRA and offer a refund, encouraging you to click on a link provided in their message. </p>
<p>If you click on the message, you may be asked to provide personal information such as your SIN, date of birth or your name. Then you will be asked to provide your online banking information to accept the refund by e-transfer. </p>
	  <p><strong>What to do: </strong>If you receive a text message claiming to be from the CRA, <strong>do not reply</strong>. The CRA will not use text messages or instant messages to start a conversation with you about your refund.</p>
	 

	  <h3>Fraudulent tax returns - identity theft</h3>
 
	 <p><strong>What is it: </strong>Bad actors target Canadians, and use your personal information (such as user ID and password) to file fraudulent tax returns. This type of identity theft can target all Canadians. </p>
<p>A scammer could file a fraudulent income tax return with personal information, and could change a personal address or direct deposit information. Scammers use different methods to obtain your personal information, such as data and privacy breaches occurring outside of the CRA. </p>
<p><strong>How to recognize it: </strong>You may notice a change on your account, or receive an email notification saying your account has been modified without your knowledge. You may also notice a delay in receiving credits or refunds that you were expecting, or have difficulty filing your tax return online.</p>
<p><strong>What to do: </strong>If you notice a change on your account has been made, and you did not make it, contact the CRA as soon as possible at 1-800-959-8281. The CRA will work diligently to protect and resolve issues for those impacted by fraudulent activity. You will not be held liable for unauthorized claims made by fraudsters using your account, and you may also be offered free creditor protection services.</p>
	 
	  
<h3>Extortion phone call</h3>
	   
<p><strong>What is it: </strong>Extortion phone calls from scammers claiming to be from the CRA, targeting any Canadian, year round.</p>
<p><strong>How to recognize it: </strong>Scammers are using a method known as spoofing to hide their number and show a different number on your phone display. They may use a local number which will appear on your call display, or use numbers from local law enforcement agencies or governments. At the beginning of the call, the scam may ask you to confirm your SIN. They will then demand payment from you by Bitcoin or by gift cards. </p>
<p><strong>What to do: </strong>The CRA will not use aggressive language or demand immediate payment by Bitcoin, prepaid credit cards or gift cards. </p>
	  
	  
	 

	  <h3>Phishing email offering refund</h3>
<p><strong>What is it: </strong>Email phishing scams where scammers are impersonating the CRA to offer refunds to Canadians, targeting any Canadian, year round.</p>
<p><strong>How to recognize it: </strong>Scammers will add a legitimate CRA email address as the display name. In the email, they will tell you the CRA needs to send a refund, and to click on the link provided. If you click on the link, you will be asked to provide personal information such as your SIN, date of birth or your name. Then you will be asked to provide your online banking information to accept the refund by e-transfer. </p>
	  <p>The CRA will not ask you to provide personal information by email or send requests for e-transfers.</p>
<p><strong>What to do: </strong>If you hover (do not click) your computer mouse over the name of the sender, or type the email into your web browser, you may be able to identify where the email address is coming from. These email addresses also change with every message that is sent. If you’re not sure if the email came from the CRA, do not reply and call the CRA.</p>
	

<h2 id="h2">Examples of fraudulent communications</h2>
        

	  <p>You may get a communication from a person aggressively telling you to pay the taxes you owe and claiming to be from the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>
