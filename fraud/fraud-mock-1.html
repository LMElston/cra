<p>You may get a phone call from a person aggressively telling you to pay the taxes you owe. This person will claim to be from the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>  <p>In an effort to prevent you from falling prey to these cons, the CRA is releasing transcripts of the scams that are currently targeting taxpayers.</p>

<h4>The CRA may</h4>
<ul>
<li>verify your identity by asking for personal information such as your full name, date of birth, address and account, or social insurance number</li>
<li>ask for details about your account, in the case of a business enquiry</li>
<li>call you to begin an audit process</li>
<li>call you to offer <a href="/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/liaison-officer-initiative-loi.html">free tax help</a> for your small business</li>
</ul>
<h4>The CRA will never</h4>
<ul>
<li>ask for information about your passport, health card, or driver's license</li>
<li>demand immediate payment by Interac e-transfer, bitcoin, prepaid credit cards or gift cards from retailers such as iTunes, Amazon, or others</li>
<li>use aggressive language or threaten you with arrest or sending the police</li>
<li>leave voicemails that are threatening or give personal or financial information</li>
</ul>
 <h4>Caller ID Spoofing</h4>
 <p>Caller ID is a useful function. However, the information displayed can be altered by criminals. Never use only the displayed information to confirm the identity of the caller whether it be an individual, a company or a government entity.</p>  
 <h4>Sample 1</h4>
 <p>The first example is a voice message that was received by a CRA employee based in Halifax and contains several red flags you should be aware of:</p> 
  <div class="panel well-sm wb-mltmd well">
        <div class="panel-body">
            <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Transcript:</strong><br> The reason behind this call is to notify you that we have registered a criminal case against your name concerning a tax evasion and tax fraud in the federal court house.&nbsp; So if you want any further information about this case, please make sure you give us a call back as quick as possible to our direct hotline number to the Canada Revenue Agency Headquarters. That is 613-927-9919, I will please repeat the number, it is 613-927-9919.&nbsp; If we don’t receive a call from your side, please be prepared to face the legal consequences, as the issue of tax is extremely serious and time-sensitive. So have a blessed time.&nbsp;</p>

   <h4>Sample 2</h4>
 <p>The second example is a voice message of telephone scam in which the caller urges the listener to return a call, before legal action is taken against them. The call contains several red flags that you should be aware of:</p>  
 <div class="panel well-sm wb-mltmd well">
        <div class="panel-body">

  <h4>Sample 3</h4>
 <p>The third example is another voice message telephone scam in which the caller urges the listener to return a call before legal action is taken against them. The call contains several red flags that you should be aware of:</p>  

    <div class="panel well-sm wb-mltmd well">

<h4>Sample 4</h4>
 <p>The fourth example is a scam phone call to Nate Brideau, a Winnipeg-based corporate tax specialist. Nate recognized the scam early. He recorded several calls the scammers made and sent the recordings to the <em>Winnipeg Free Press</em>, which published <a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/Scamming-the-scammer-337227261.html">an article on the issue</a>.&nbsp;</p>  
 
        <h4>Sample 5</h4>
<p>To hear another example of a phone scam, go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfjd7RjoBSU">CBC’s recording of a phone scam</a>.</p>
 
<h3 class="text-primary">By email</h3>
<h4>The CRA may</h4>
<ul>
<li>notify you by email when a new message or a document, such as a notice of assessment or reassessment, is available for you to view in secure CRA portals such as My Account, My Business Account, or Represent a Client</li>
<li>email you a link to a CRA webpage, form, or publication that you ask for <strong>during</strong> a telephone call or a meeting with an agent (this is the only case where the CRA will send an email containing links)</li>
</ul>
<h4>The CRA will never</h4>
<ul>
<li>give or ask for personal or financial information by email and ask you to click on a link</li>
<li>email you a link asking you to fill in an online form with personal or financial details</li>
<li>send you an email with a link to your refund</li>
<li>demand immediate payment by Interac e-transfer, bitcoin, prepaid credit cards or gift cards from retailers such as iTunes, Amazon, or others</li>
<li>threaten you with arrest or a prison sentence</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-primary">By mail</h3>
<h4>The CRA may</h4>
<ul>
<li>ask for financial information such as the name of your bank and its location</li>
<li>send you a notice of assessment or reassessment</li>
<li>ask you to pay an amount you owe through any of the CRA's <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/make-a-payment-canada-revenue-agency.html">payment options</a></li>
<li>take legal action to recover the money you owe, if you refuse to pay your debt</li>
<li>write to you to begin an audit process</li>
<li>write to you to offer <a href="/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/liaison-officer-initiative-loi.html">free tax help</a> for your small business</li>
</ul>
<h4>The CRA will never</h4>
<ul>
<li>set up a meeting with you in a public place to take a payment</li>
<li>demand immediate payment by Interac e-transfer, bitcoin, prepaid credit cards or gift cards from retailers such as iTunes, Amazon, or others</li>
<li>threaten you with arrest or a prison sentence</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-primary">By text messages/instant messaging</h3>
<p>The CRA <strong>never</strong> uses text messages or instant messaging such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp to communicate with taxpayers under any circumstance. If a taxpayer receives text or instant messages claiming to be from the CRA, they are scams!</p>
<h3>When in doubt, ask yourself</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why is the caller pressuring me to act immediately? Am I certain the caller is a CRA employee?</li>
<li>Did I file my tax return on time? Have I received a notice of assessment or reassessment saying I owe tax?</li>
<li>Have I received written communication from the CRA by email or mail about the subject of the call?</li>
<li>Does the CRA have my most recent contact information, such as my email and address?</li>
<li>Is the caller asking for information I would not give in my tax return or that is not related to the money I owe the CRA?</li>
<li>Did I recently send a request to change my business number information?</li>
<li>Do I have an instalment payment due soon?</li>
<li>Have I received a statement of account about a government program I owe money to, such as employment insurance or Canada Student Loans?</li>
</ul>

   <p>If you do have a debt with the CRA and can't pay in full, take action right away. For more information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra.html">When you owe money – collections at the CRA</a>.</p>
    
        <h3>Handouts</h3>
<p>When the CRA contacts you, it makes sure your personal information is protected. These handouts explain what the CRA will and will not do when making contact with taxpayers.</p>
